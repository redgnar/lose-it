1. Who is the primary target user for FamilyMeal MVP (e.g., parents cooking for families, individuals with medical dietary needs, fitness-focused users, people with allergies), and what are the top 2–3 “must-support” dietary constraints at launch?
   Recommendation: Pick a primary persona and limit MVP dietary constraints to the highest-impact set (e.g., allergies + vegetarian/vegan + gluten-free) to reduce complexity and improve AI output quality.

2. What is the exact “unit of value” users get from the app: modifying an existing recipe they paste in, generating a new recipe from scratch, or both—and which one is the MVP priority?
   Recommendation: Prioritize one core flow (likely “paste recipe → tailor recipe”) to keep scope tight, then add the secondary flow once retention is proven.

3. What does “saving, reading, browsing” mean in terms of recipe structure—free-text only, or do we require fields like title, servings, ingredients list, steps, tags, and prep/cook time?
   Recommendation: Use a minimal structured schema (title + servings + ingredients + steps) even if entered as text, so AI transformations and browsing become more reliable.

4. How will users input recipes in MVP (manual typing, copy/paste text, template form), and what validation/format guidance is expected?
   Recommendation: Optimize for copy/paste with lightweight formatting helpers (e.g., “Ingredients” / “Steps” sections) to reduce friction and improve AI parsing.

5. What specific transformations should AI guarantee (e.g., ingredient substitutions, removing allergens, calorie reduction, portion scaling, macro targets), and what is “good enough” output quality for MVP?
   Recommendation: Define 3–5 supported transformation types with clear acceptance criteria and provide an editable output so users can quickly correct AI mistakes.

6. How should the dietary preferences profile be represented (simple checkboxes vs. detailed rules like “low sodium < X mg/day”, disliked ingredients, cuisine preferences), and what is required to count as “filled out”?
   Recommendation: Start with a short, guided onboarding that captures essentials (allergens + diet type + avoid list) and define “profile complete” as those required fields to hit the 90% metric.

7. What is the intended browsing experience for recipes (search, filters by diet, recent, favorites), and what is the minimum needed to support weekly generation behavior?
   Recommendation: Launch with “Recent”, “Favorites”, and basic search by title/keyword; add diet-based filters only if the recipe schema supports it without heavy manual tagging.

8. What are the precise definitions and measurement plan for success criteria: “dietary preferences filled” and “generate one or more recipes per week” (events, time windows, what counts as a generated recipe)?
   Recommendation: Instrument analytics from day one with clear events (profile_completed, recipe_created, recipe_modified_ai, recipe_saved, recipe_viewed) and define weekly active generation as a measurable funnel.

9. What are the key safety and trust requirements for AI-modified recipes (allergen guarantees, cross-contamination disclaimers, nutrition accuracy expectations, medical advice boundaries)?
   Recommendation: Add explicit UX guardrails: highlight changed ingredients, show a diff view, require confirmation for allergen-related changes, and include disclaimers that outputs should be verified.

10. What are the delivery constraints—target platform (web/mobile), authentication method, expected timeline, team size, and budget for AI usage—and what are the biggest technical risks (cost, latency, hallucinations)?
    Recommendation: Choose the fastest platform (often web), use a simple auth solution, set cost/latency budgets (e.g., <5s response), and mitigate risk with caching, prompt templates, and fallback behavior when AI fails.
