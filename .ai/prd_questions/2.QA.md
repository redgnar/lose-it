1. What is the concrete “weight loss tailoring” goal the AI should optimize for (e.g., reduce calories by X%, target calories per serving, target daily calorie range, reduce fat/carbs, increase protein)?
   Recommendation: Define 1–2 primary optimization modes (e.g., “Reduce calories per serving” + “Scale portions to X servings”) with clear defaults so outputs are consistent and measurable.

2. Do users provide personal context beyond an avoid list (e.g., target calories/day, target calories/meal, current weight/goal weight, meal type), or is MVP purely recipe-centric without personal stats?
   Recommendation: Keep MVP recipe-centric but include one optional numeric preference like “target calories per serving” to improve relevance without needing full profile data.

3. How will the app estimate calories for a pasted recipe (ingredient database lookup vs. user-entered nutrition vs. AI approximation), and what level of accuracy is acceptable?
   Recommendation: Start with AI-based estimation + transparent “estimated calories” labeling, and store per-ingredient parsed quantities to enable future upgrades to a nutrition database.

4. What is the expected output format after tailoring—rewrite the full recipe, or show a structured “before/after” including new servings, updated ingredient quantities, and modified steps?
   Recommendation: Provide a clear diff-style view (Original vs. Tailored) and a “copy/save tailored version” action to increase trust and reduce confusion even without formal safety requirements.

5. How should portion scaling interact with calorie reduction (e.g., scale first then reduce, or reduce then scale), and should the user be able to choose the number of servings directly?
   Recommendation: Make servings an explicit control (“Servings: 1–12”) and apply deterministic scaling first, then apply calorie-reduction substitutions so results are predictable.

6. What constraints are off-limits for the AI when reducing calories (e.g., keep recipe “similar”, preserve cuisine, don’t remove core ingredients, avoid expensive ingredients, max number of substitutions)?
   Recommendation: Add simple constraints toggles like “Keep it similar” and “Max changes: low/medium/high” to control transformation aggressiveness and improve satisfaction.

7. What is the minimal “profile complete” definition now that there are “no constraints” and the audience is weight loss—does an avoid list alone count, and is it required?
   Recommendation: Redefine “profile complete” as either (a) at least one avoid item OR (b) one weight-loss preference set (e.g., target calories/serving), so the 90% goal stays meaningful.

8. What is the MVP onboarding flow sequence: sign in first, or try tailoring first and then prompt account creation to save results?
   Recommendation: Allow “try once without account” and gate saving behind login to reduce drop-off, while still driving profile completion after the first successful tailor.

9. What should “generate one or more recipes per week” mean in this clarified scope—does “tailor a recipe” count as generation, and does viewing/saving count?
   Recommendation: Define the success event as “recipe_tailored_success” (AI returns tailored recipe) and measure weekly active users with ≥1 success event, plus a secondary metric for saves.

10. For authentication, which providers and account flows are in-scope for MVP (Google OAuth only vs. Google + email/password), and what is the fallback if OAuth fails?
    Recommendation: Start with Google OAuth only (fastest + lowest friction) and add email/password later; ensure a clear “Continue with Google” CTA and a lightweight session/token strategy for responsive web.
